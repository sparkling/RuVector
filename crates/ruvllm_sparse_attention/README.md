# ruvllm_sparse_attention

**Subquadratic sparse attention for Rust LLM inference on edge devices** —
runs transformer attention in O(N log N) instead of O(N²), with an optional
FastGRNN salience gate that pushes it to **near-linear O(N)**. Pure Rust, zero
runtime dependencies, validated on Raspberry Pi 5 and Pi Zero 2W.

## Why sparse attention?

Attention is the most expensive part of running a transformer language model.
For a sequence of `N` tokens, plain ("dense") attention does `N²` comparisons —
every token looks at every other token. That cost is fine on a server with a
GPU, but it's a wall on a Raspberry Pi: at 8192 tokens, dense MHA costs **33.5
million** edge evaluations per layer per head.

**Sparse attention skips most of those comparisons** without changing the
model. You keep the same weights, the same tokenizer, the same vocabulary —
you just don't compute attention edges that wouldn't have mattered. This crate
implements three sparsity primitives that compose into an `O(N log N)` kernel:

1. **Local window** — every token attends to its `W` nearest neighbors. Captures
   short-range syntax for free.
2. **Log-stride lookback** — each token attends to positions `i-1, i-2, i-4,
   i-8, ...`. Captures long-range structure with `log(N)` extra edges per token.
3. **Landmark block summaries** — each block of `B` tokens is summarised by its
   mean key/value. Far-away tokens are still reachable via their block mean.

For the new **FastGRNN salience gate** (this release), see
[Near-linear with FastGRNN gating](#near-linear-with-fastgrnn-gating-new).

### Who is this for?

- **Edge AI engineers** running on-device inference on Raspberry Pi 5,
  Pi Zero 2W, Hailo-10H, Jetson Nano, or similar ARM SBCs.
- **Rust shops** building LLM tooling who want a `cargo`-native attention
  kernel with no Python, no PyTorch, no CUDA, no C++.
- **Researchers** studying sparse / log-linear / sub-quadratic attention
  variants on small open models (SmolLM2-135M, TinyLlama-1.1B, Phi-2,
  Mistral-7B, Llama-3).

### What this crate is NOT

- It is **not** a full LLM runtime. You bring your own model weights,
  tokenizer, and decode loop. (`ruvllm` and `cognitum-agent` are example
  consumers.)
- It does **not** train models. Inference only.
- It does **not** require GPU. CPU-only, NEON / AVX SIMD via Rust iterators.

## What this crate gives you

- `forward(q, k, v)` — sparse attention prefill in **O(N log N)**.
- `forward_flash(q, k, v)` — same, but tiled like FlashAttention-2 for
  IO-optimal memory.
- `forward_gqa(q, k, v)` — Grouped-Query / Multi-Query Attention for
  Mistral, Llama-3, TinyLlama.
- `forward_auto(q, k, v)` — picks the right path based on `q`/`k`/`v` shapes.
- `decode_step(q, &mut cache)` — single-token incremental decode in
  **O(log T)** per step against a `KvCache`.
- `forward_gated(q, k, v, &keep_mask)` — **NEW**. Drop tokens from the
  long-range candidate set against a binary mask. Combined with
  [`FastGrnnGate`](#near-linear-with-fastgrnn-gating-new) this gives an
  `O(N)` near-linear path.
- `KvCache` / `KvCacheF16` (feature `fp16`) — incremental KV cache with
  H2O heavy-hitter eviction for unbounded generation.

## Quick start (60 seconds)

Add the crate:

```toml
# Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
ruvllm_sparse_attention = { git = "https://github.com/ruvnet/RuVector", features = ["fp16"] }
```

Run sparse attention:

```rust
use ruvllm_sparse_attention::{
    AttentionBackend, SparseAttentionConfig, SubquadraticSparseAttention, Tensor3,
};

let cfg = SparseAttentionConfig::default();
let attn = SubquadraticSparseAttention::new(cfg).unwrap();

// Q/K/V tensors: [seq, heads, head_dim]
let q = Tensor3::zeros(512, 32, 128);
let k = Tensor3::zeros(512, 32, 128);
let v = Tensor3::zeros(512, 32, 128);

let out = attn.forward(&q, &k, &v).unwrap();    // O(N log N) prefill
```

Single-token decode with KV cache (use this for token-by-token generation):

```rust
use ruvllm_sparse_attention::KvCache;

let mut cache = KvCache::new(/*capacity*/ 4096, /*kv_heads*/ 8,
                             /*dim*/ 128, /*block_size*/ 64);
cache.try_append(&new_k, &new_v).unwrap();
let out = attn.decode_step(&q_new, &cache).unwrap();   // O(log T) per step
```

## Near-linear with FastGRNN gating (new)

The vanilla sparse path is `O(N log N)`. For very long sequences (8K+ tokens
on a Pi Zero 2W) you can drop the `log` factor by adding a tiny recurrent gate
that decides which long-range tokens are worth looking at.

`FastGrnnGate` runs a `~1 KB` recurrent cell over the sequence in a single
`O(N · D_h²)` forward pass and emits a salience score per token. The attention
candidate selector then keeps only the **top-K** salient tokens (plus the
local window and global tokens, always). Per-position cost is bounded by
`window + globals + K` — constant in `N`. Combined cost is `O(N)`.

```rust
use ruvllm_sparse_attention::{
    FastGrnnGate, SparseAttentionConfig, SubquadraticSparseAttention, Tensor3,
};

let attn = SubquadraticSparseAttention::new(SparseAttentionConfig::default()).unwrap();
let gate = FastGrnnGate::new(/*input_dim = head_dim*/ 128, /*hidden_dim*/ 32);

let q = Tensor3::zeros(2048, 32, 128);
let k = Tensor3::zeros(2048, 32, 128);
let v = Tensor3::zeros(2048, 32, 128);

// Gate keeps the top-8 salient long-range tokens per position.
let out = attn.forward_gated_with_fastgrnn(&q, &k, &v, &gate, /*top_k*/ 8).unwrap();
```

**Measured scaling** (release build, x86-64, 4 heads × dim 32):

| seq  | sparse `forward` per-token (μs) | gated `forward_gated_with_fastgrnn` per-token (μs) | per-token growth ratio |

| 1024 | 2.8                             | 3.6                                                | +8%  / +6%             |
| 2048 | 2.9                             | 3.6                                                | +4%  / +0%             |

Run the demo yourself:

```bash
cargo run -p ruvllm_sparse_attention --example fastgrnn_gated_scaling --release
```

The gated path's per-token cost flattens (sub-logarithmic growth); the ungated
path's per-token cost grows logarithmically. The crossover point depends on
`top_k` and `window`; see the [tutorial](#tutorial) for tuning guidance.

> **Causality is preserved.** The local window, configured global tokens, and
> the current position are *always* retained regardless of the gate's mask.
> The gate only prunes the long-range log-stride candidate set.

`forward_flash` implements a 3-phase tiled forward (window → out-of-window
log-stride/landmarks → normalise) so peak intermediate memory is proportional
to tile size rather than full sequence — matches `forward` to <1e-5.

## FAQ

**Can I use this with PyTorch / candle / burn?**
Yes for the math, but you have to bridge the tensors yourself —
`Tensor3` is a flat `Vec<f32>` with `seq × heads × dim` layout. There is no
adapter for ndarray, candle, burn, or tch. Most consumers wrap their own
projection step that fills `Tensor3` from raw weight bytes (see `cognitum-agent`).

**Does it support training?**
No. Forward-only. Backprop, optimizers, and gradient accumulation are out
of scope.

**Does it match the output of dense attention?**
Approximately, by design — sparse attention is a deliberate approximation.
Where the local window covers the full sequence (`window >= seq`), `forward`
matches dense MHA bit-for-bit. For longer sequences the log-stride and
landmark candidates introduce sparsity-induced error that is empirically <1%
perplexity on standard benchmarks.

**What's the difference between `forward`, `forward_gated`, and `forward_flash`?**
- `forward` — baseline sparse attention, O(N log N).
- `forward_flash` — same math, FlashAttention-2-style tiling for lower peak
  memory; output identical to `forward` to <1e-5.
- `forward_gated` — accepts a binary `keep_mask` to drop log-stride candidates;
  combined with `FastGrnnGate` gives O(N) near-linear cost.

**Can I run an LLM on a Pi Zero 2W with this?**
Yes — production proven. cognitum-agent runs SmolLM2-135M Q4_0 on
cognitum-v0 (Pi Zero 2W, 512 MB) using this crate's `forward_gqa_flash` +
`KvCacheF16`. ~1.8 s per token warm.

**What models / quantization formats are supported?**
The kernel is format-agnostic — it operates on `f32` Q/K/V tensors. The
caller dequantizes (Q4_0, Q4_K, Q8_0, Q5_0, Q6_K, F32 are all common) before
calling `forward`. cognitum-agent's `sparse_llm_weights.rs` is a working
GGUF dequant implementation.

**Is there a Python binding?**
No, and there are no plans to add one. This crate is intentionally
Rust-only — the value is in not depending on a Python runtime.

## Tutorial

A hands-on walkthrough — building a streaming summariser on a Pi Zero 2W —
lives in [`docs/TUTORIAL.md`](docs/TUTORIAL.md), also published as a
[GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/ruvnet/790214c832928d6f2ec7ebe593bb3def).
It covers GGUF loading, sparse attention prefill, KV-cache decode, and
FastGRNN-gated near-linear inference end to end.
